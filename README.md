# 🚀 Get Started

**This repo is where attendees go to continue their learning after your session — and your Copilot agent will help you set it up.**

### Step 1: Open your repo

Open this repo in a **Codespace** (click the green **Code** button → **Create a Codespace**) — or clone it locally. Then open **GitHub Copilot Chat**.

### Step 2: Add your content

Give the agent something to work with. Drag files into the Explorer panel — session abstracts, outlines, screenshots, notes — and drop them in one of two places:

| Where to put it | What goes there | Who sees it |
|---|---|---|
| **`_remove-before-publish/`** | Internal reference materials (abstracts, outlines, screenshots, planning docs) | **Copilot only** — never published |
| **`/docs/`, `/src/`, or repo root** | Lab instructions, demo code, sample data, getting-started guides | **Attendees** — published with the repo |

> 💡 Not sure? Start by dropping your session abstract or outline into `_remove-before-publish/`. The agent will figure out what to do with it.

### Step 3: Ask the Agent

Once your content is in the repo, use these three phrases with Copilot to build out your session repo:

| Phrase to use with Copilot | What it does | When to run it |
|---|---|---|
| **"Help me get started"** | Sets up session title, description, outcomes, and owners | After you've added your session abstract or outline to the repo |
| **"Help me refine content"** | Organizes your session content into the repo | Each time you add or update content |
| **"Help me finalize"** | Final review, cleanup, and publication prep | When you're ready to publish |

> 💡 **These three phrases are just the starting point.** Copilot can do much more — try asking it to brainstorm next steps for attendees, generate code samples, or build out your repo structure. Don't be afraid to put it in plan mode and ask for what you need.

## 🔥 DEM334: Build agents where work happens: chats, channels, and meetings in Microsoft Teams

### Session Description

Agents are moving beyond simple chat experiences. With the Teams SDK, developers can build agents that participate directly in the flow of work across chats, channels, and meetings. In this session, you'll learn how to leverage Teams capabilities and create agents that automate tasks, surface insights, and take action in context without pulling users out of Teams.

### 🚀 Getting started

This demo is a walkthrough of what's new in the Microsoft Teams SDK and how to build agents in collaborative spaces (chats, channels, meetings). There's no sample code in this repo — to start building your own agent, use the Teams Developer CLI:

- Install and scaffold a new agent with the [Teams Developer CLI](https://microsoft.github.io/teams-sdk/cli/)
- Read the [Microsoft Teams SDK docs](https://microsoft.github.io/teams-sdk/welcome) for concepts and reference
- Explore additional links in the [📚 Resources and Next Steps](#-resources-and-next-steps) table below

### 🧠 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this demo, you will be able to:

- Use the Microsoft Teams SDK to build agents that participate directly in chats, channels, and meetings.
- Design agent experiences that automate tasks, surface insights, and take action in the user's flow of work.
- Apply Teams-native capabilities so agents stay in context without pulling users out of Teams.

### 💬 Keep Learning with Copilot

Try these prompts with GitHub Copilot to explore the topics from this demo. Open Copilot Chat in Visual Studio Code (`Ctrl+Alt+I` on Windows/Linux, `Cmd+Shift+I` on Mac), paste a prompt, and see what you learn. Try connecting the [Microsoft Learn MCP Server](#-microsoft-learn-mcp-server) for the latest official documentation.

Use these as a starting point — or write your own!

### 💻 Technologies Used

1. [Microsoft Teams SDK](https://microsoft.github.io/teams-sdk/welcome) — the primary SDK for building agents that run natively in Microsoft Teams chats, channels, and meetings.
